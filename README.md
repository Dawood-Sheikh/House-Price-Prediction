# Introduction:

The housing market reflects the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest to buyers and sellers. The purpose of this project is to predict house prices 
using explanatory variables covering many aspects of residential housing. This project aims to build a regression model that will estimate the house price accurately 
based on its features.

For that we've to form a regression model that's able to accurately estimate the value of the house given the options and to reduce the distinction between expected 
and actual rating (RMSE). Almost all aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA areexplained by 79 variables (features).

## User Requirements
* Hardware requirements:
  1. Operating system- Windows 7,8,10
  2. Processor- Dual core 2.4 GHz (i5 or i7 series Intel processor or equivalent AMD)
  3. RAM - 4GB
* Software Requirements:
  1. Python 3.8
  2. PyCharm
  3. PIP
  4. Jupyter Notebook
  5. Anaconda
  6. Chrome
  7. Cloud Environment to Deploy Model

## Unresolved Issues:

Due to lack of technical requirements we will be assuming the ideal parameters of the XGBoost
Regressor.

## Analysis of Work Done and Design
### Goals:
* To develop an efficient and effective model which predict the sale price for each
house.
* To achieve good accuracy by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual
rating (RMSE/MSE)

## Data & Attributes:
We have used a data set uploaded by Dean De Cock on Kaggle for a competition. You can download the data set from this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
It consists of four files, namely as:

* data_desription.txt
* sample_submission.csv
* test.csv
* train.csv

The dataset contains **2919 records (rows)** and **80 features (columns) (including ‘SalePrice’ column of the train dataset)**. **data_description.txt** consists of 
the information about all the features listed in the train and test csv files.

# Code is uploaded and accessible for knowledge purpose!

# Conclusions:
With the increase in the demand for the houses and lack of proper evaluation of the prices of those housed, the demand for automated prediction models is increased. 
The House Price Prediction system which effectively determines the worthiness of the house using a variety of features is useful not only for real-estate companies
but also for individual buyers who are on the lookout for their dream home. The proposed system will help to determine the near-accurate price of the houses.
